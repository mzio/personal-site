Two things I think are pretty cool: the Tokyo subway system and Markov chains. In all seriousness, as a big proponent of learning by doing, I'm always trying to figure out how to combine some theory with real-world application, motivated by creating something cool in the process. Coming home from two weeks in Tokyo + Shanghai and a week in the Bay Area at [Hack Lodge](https://hacklodge.org/), it was a fun way to combine some things I knew about for some time (making maps, markov chains), with things I recently learned about (the Tokyo metro, the "joys" of React and front-end), and a tiny relation to a preview of stuff yet to come ([Stat 212 fun](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~pillai/Teaching_files/syllabus.pdf)...).

There's some thinking / writing I want to get to first, but as part of this side-project thing posts for how I went about creating it will be coming up as well.
