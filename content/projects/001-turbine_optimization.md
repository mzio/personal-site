Multivariable calculus was a fun time, and for a class project we were tasked with solving a Lagrange optimization problem. This was around the time I started learning about GitHub Pages and hosting websites for various club and activity-related things, so in my youthful enthusiasm I thought it'd be cool to turn in a website for the assignment.    

Unfortunately for some reason I didn't include the original questions, so it's kind of limited there. That being said I'm keeping it here because it's up on GitHub and at the time I thought GitHub pages was a super cool way to host anything.
