## me

I'm a third year student at Harvard, concentrating in Statistics and Computer Science.

Outside of class, I find myself involved in strictly [four-letter](https://www.harvardconsulting.org/) [acronym](https://www.google.com/search?q=aadt&oq=aadt&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60.979j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) clubs, trying to do research, and constantly interested in building things / doing side-projects.

## this site

A friend of mine once had a Russian piano teacher...

Just kidding. But to anyone who's seen a previous version of this site, this is about the third or fourth iteration of a corner of the web I've tried to carve out for myself. Hoping this time's a charm.

Built with love, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and the [Tale](https://themes.gohugo.io/tale-hugo/) theme.

## the purpose

Mix of an academic and online presence. Place to motivate thoughts on life, school, and side projects. Excuse to build silly things like [this](https://michaelzhang.xyz).
