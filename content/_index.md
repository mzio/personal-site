Welcome to my rendition of yet another vaguely academic personal site (that also sort of looks like the [rest](http://demo.getpoole.com/) [of](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/) [them](https://academicpages.github.io/))!

In all seriousness, I'm Michael, a rising senior at Harvard who likes thinking about statistics along with some types of economics (market design, game theory) and computer science (mostly ML).

I'll be working with [Serena Yeung](http://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/) this summer, and just finished up a research-heavy semester on meta-learning and reinforcement learning at the [Stastical RL Lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html) with Serena and [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/), and [Google Brain](https://sites.google.com/view/harvardcs282r/home) primarily with [Alex D'Amour](https://www.alexdamour.com/).

Before that I spent a summer doing quant research at [DRW](https://drw.com/), and before that I built tools in computational healthcare with [Ken Mandl](http://www.childrenshospital.org/research/researchers/m/kenneth-mandl) at [Boston Childrens' Hospital](https://www.chip.org/) and genome editing with [George Church](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/) at Harvard Medical School and the [Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/technologies/?taxonomy=focus_area&term=125).
